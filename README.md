<h1>Blackjack By Tom - A Google Chrome Extension</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project I started to teach myself DOM with JavaScript as it was a skill I was looking to implement in some of my other web projects. The project features a fully functional blackjack game with all game logic and a betting system included. This project has been approved by the Chrome Store and is currently listed here, https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blackjack-by-tom/pmhlnhkpkibmmdnkknhdjhaeeolhhbfe.

Currently, it has 800 active users and is under review for a styling facelift.
